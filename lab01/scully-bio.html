<body>
Currently I am a Television, Radio, and Film major within the Newhouse School at Syracuse University with a minor in Information Management and Technology. I am interested in broadcast television along with production management. I currently work at a local television station as a Master Control Operator/ Technical Media Producer as well as interned at a consumer insights company. Outside of school and work I like to explore the Adirondacks and play with my dog, a miniature Schnauzer named Oliver.
